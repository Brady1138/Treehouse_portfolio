        <h2>What Got Me Here?</h2>
        <p>I graduated from Texas Tech University School of Media and Communications in 2015. As a long time movie buff and reader I was passionate about narrative storytelling and invention in media, applying my interests to learn Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and After Effects, both as a hobby and for my career.</p>
        <p>While hopping from being a movie theater projectionist to a marketer for a small law firm, I discovered a new skillset: computers. I learned that I loved solving puzzles and challenges and figuring out how things work. Before I knew it I was prioritizing fixing computer related issues over video and design tasks! Through that, I discovered the potential in the field of programming, which is where I'm at now!</p>
